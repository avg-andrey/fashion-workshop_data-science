# Sentiment Analysis on User Reviews

## Overview

This project is a **Data Science template** for conducting a **Sentiment Analysis on User Reviews**, leveraging Python for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning. The repository serves as a comprehensive guide, structured to align with business objectives and demonstrate effective data processing, analysis, and modeling techniques.

## Features

- **Business Objectives Definition**: Clear and measurable objectives for driving business decisions.
- **Data Flow and Business Process Mapping**: Detailed understanding of data origins, transformations, and usage.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: In-depth data exploration and visualization to uncover patterns and insights.
- **Sentiment Classification**: Using Machine Learning models to classify user reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.
- **End-to-End Pipeline**: From defining objectives to model deployment.
